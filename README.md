# Traffic Conditions using Distance API and Routes API

Obtaining Traffic Condition and Traffic Information

To run:
1. Download the HTML file and open in browser of choice.
2. Make sure to allow location services.
3. Ensure that developer options are enabled in the browser to view the information displayed in the console.

Note:
The variable known as 'currentDistance" is harcoded for testing purposes. This value can be changed to simulate getting the current distance and determining the traffic condition.

This task allows the user to input start and end addresses, aided by auto-fill via the Places API, to find a route and determine the legs along the route and corresponding traffic conditions.
